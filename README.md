# PythonProjects
Here are some of my python projects. THey are simple scripts meant to perform some analysis or get data from the web in a convenient manner

A brief explanation of the projects is below.

trending cryptocurrencies webscraper: 
  In this project I parse Coingecko to get data on the CryptoCurrencies which gained the most (percentege wise) over the last 24 Hours.
  I decided to do this project since an API was not available for this specific information, and I wanted to run some analyses on the data without having to type everything in manueally. 
  This project requires the libraries pandas, beatifulsoup4, requests and selenium (as well as the Google chromedriver).
